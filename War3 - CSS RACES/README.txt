#Basic Terms & Conditions.#
-----------------

1) While a lot of this code has been created by Remy Lebeau, Kibbles and ABGar, a lot of it was adapted from other sources.  We have no desire or intention to pass off other people's 
work as our own.  If any of the material here is yours, and you do not want it distributed, please contact Remy via the war3source.com forums.

2) Feel free to use / redistribute this code as you see fit.  Please keep any original attribution in place, and if need be include a comment to detail that you have taken the code from here.

3) If for any reason you wish to ADD CODE to this repository (whether it's by fixing up what is currently there, or want to add more), feel free to make a pull request.  I will only approve
as I have time to review it though, so don't expect a quick add.

#Code Information#
-----------------

1) The majority of the interesting code is found in CSS Plugins / Races / Compile OK /

2) The code is provided entirely AS IS.  In order to use it you need to know how to compile it yourself.  A guide I created a while back is available here:

3) Some races / plugins require custom models.  None of the models are provided here, you will need to source your own.

4) Some races require custom include files - they are in the w3incs folder.  I know, it's not great style, but hey, it worked!
